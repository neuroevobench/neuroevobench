# Benchmark Utilities for `evosax` Strategies ü¶ï ü¶ñ üê¢

This repository contains benchmark results, helper scripts, ES configurations and logs for testing the performance of evolutionary strategies in [`evosax`](https://github.com/RobertTLange/evosax/).

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Benchmarks for a Single ES + Problem

### Launching a Single Configuration & Single Seed Run

```
python train -config configs/<ES>/<problem>.yaml
```

### Launching a Multi-Seed Grid Search

```
mle run configs/<ES>/search_<problem>.yaml
```

## Experiment Plans

Brax: Can do ca. 3 generations/min of brax on 8 CPU with 16 pmap devices
-> ca. 3/6 hours per run (2.5/5 days for 20x IMP)
-> 15 nodes = 30 parallel runs 
-> Ca. 10 batches for 10x10x3 = 2.5-4 days
-> Ca. 3 batches for 5x5x3 = 18 hours

MNIST: Can do ca. 40 generations of mnist/3min on 10 CPU with 20 pmap devices
-> ca. 2.5 hours per run (2.5 days for 20x IMP)
-> 15 nodes = 30 parallel runs
-> Ca. 10 batches for 10x10x3 = 1 day
-> Ca 3 batches for 5x5x3 = 7.5 hours

Full grid run for one ES -> 10 min + 2.5 days + 1 day => 2 per week?

### Brax Large Experiments

- 'ant', 'halfcheetah', 'hopper', 'reacher', 'walker2d'
- 5 envs x 3 seeds x 6 algorithms = 90
- Run on V100S for time elapsed measurements!

```python
# Evaluation Function
def eval_fn(seed, params):
	score = ...  # evaluate params on seed
	return score

member_scores = []

# Loop over population members
for params in pop_members:
	seed_scores = []

	for seed_id in num_evals:

    # Store mean performance
    member_scores.append(mean(seed_scores))

# Vectorize over stochastic evaluations
score_eval = jax.vmap(eval_fn, in_axes=(0, None))
# Device-Parallelize over population members
pop_eval = jax.pmap(score_eval, in_axes=(None, 0))
# Execute both map strategies (seed & members)
member_scores = pop_eval(num_evals, pop_members).mean(axis=1)
